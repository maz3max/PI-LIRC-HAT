(1)To use this HAT, you have to install LIRC:
sudo apt-get install lirc

(2)If there is a /etc/lirc/hardware.conf, change it to this:
# /etc/lirc/hardware.conf
#
# Arguments which will be used when launching lircd
LIRCD_ARGS="-l"

#Don't start lircmd even if there seems to be a good config file
#START_LIRCMD=false

#Don't start irexec, even if a good config file seems to exist.
#START_IREXEC=false

#Try to load appropriate kernel modules
LOAD_MODULES=false

# Run "lircd --driver=help" for a list of supported drivers.
DRIVER="default"
# usually /dev/lirc0 is the correct setting for systems using udev 
DEVICE="/dev/lirc0"
MODULES="lirc_rpi"

# Default configuration files for your hardware if any
LIRCD_CONF=""
LIRCMD_CONF=""

(3)If not, update the following lines in /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf
driver    = default
device = /dev/lirc0

(4)Start the LIRC service
sudo systemctl restart lircd.service

(5)The Hardware is now ready to go! You can add your remote control definitions to lircd.conf. There is also the 'irrecord' tool to record unknown remotes.
